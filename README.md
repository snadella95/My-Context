MyContext:

Aim: Product allows the granular control of a patient record to be management by the patient themselves via interaction
with a distributed ledger. The patient can trade or auction their medical record based on bids from 3rd party
pharmaceutical or medical researchers.

Description: Clinical Records are generated throughout a person’s life relating to their points of care, interventions and
treatments as and when they need them. These records hold valuable details of a private and confidential nature.
The sharing of this information can be difficult to monitor and in clinical scenarios could lead to a compromise of
data security.
The ability to “own” and access these details would be a paradigm shift in the management of Clinical detail. The
added capability to share and moderate access would significantly add to the value of this type of information. The
use of Blockchain encryption in the securing and sharing of these records is a relatively new approach to how data is
stored, activated and permissible structures around its’ use. 
Blockchain opens up a whole new economy for the
advanced use of these details for research and development, as well as advancing the immediacy of its availability.
Use of Blockchain and “zero knowledge” data access, as well as distributed ledgers will allow for the building of an
advanced identity management platform where Patient’s (Data Owners), Institutions, Clinical and Support staff will
be registered. These users can “share” access to records and responsibility for the input details. This will allow the
warranty and trust for access and input trails as well as provenance of the details to be validated forward.
MyCONTEXT Cancer Record intends to leverage the power of Decentralised Ledger Technology (DLT) to offer
increased availability, governance and efficient access to a Patient’s record across the spectrum of Cancer care
interventions. This will create new efficiencies for patients, Cancer Services and others in the delivery of health
interventions by reducing the time and effort taken to achieve access to timely, and complete patient records and
collaborating practitioners.
